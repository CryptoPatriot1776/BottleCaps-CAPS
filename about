Bottlecaps (CAPS) 
A digital peer to peer network for the facilitation of post-apocalyptic asset transfer.



In the fictional wastelands inspired by Fallout, bottlecaps are more than currency - they're a way of life. CAPS is a GPU-mineable meme coin that embraces this legacy,
built as a blockchain where scarcity, mining, and survival intersect. 

Bottlecaps (CAPS) is a use case-specific blockchain designed to serve as a digital tribute to the Fallout universe. With a total supply of 111,000,000 CAPS (a nod to Vault 111),
the network prioritizes decentralization, community mining, and nostalgic utility - no pre-mine, no dev fund, and no central authority.


Thank you to the Bitcoin and Ravencoin developers. 

Bottlecaps was forged from the source code of Bitcoin and Ravencoin. We're eternally grateful to the 400+ developers who paved the way with secure, open-source blockchain infrastructure.
This coin wouldn't exist without your efforts.

Abstract
Bottlecaps aims to implement a blockchain optimized for fun, community engagement, and GPU-based mining. CAPS isn't just another token - it's a nod to a fictional economy that somehow
feels more grounded than the real one. Whether you're hoarding CAPS for barter, trading them for goods, or just mining them for the XP, this is your welcome to the wasteland.
