## ðŸ“œ Whitepaper

BottleCaps (CAPS) is a decentralized, GPU-mineable cryptocurrency inspired by the post-apocalyptic barter system of the Fallout game series. Itâ€™s a community-powered meme coin with a fixed supply, no premine, and no developer fund. CAPS aims to bring the fun of GPU mining back to the blockchain space â€” no gimmicks, just raw hashpower.

- **Max Supply:** 111,000,000 CAPS

- **Algorithm:** KawPoW  
- **Consensus:** Proof of Work (GPU mineable)  
- **Premine:** None

### Tokenomics

### Vision

CAPS is not a startup. Thereâ€™s no VC funding, no roadmap full of empty promises. Itâ€™s a meme, a mineable coin, and a celebration of digital freedom. If you want a coin to believe in, CAPS is probably not it. But if you want a coin to mine, hold, and meme with your friends â€” welcome to the Wasteland.
